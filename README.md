## Hi there 👋

Hey! I'm Dan — a software engineer with ~8 years of experience building things at scale. I've spent most of my career at Google, working across Cloud, Ads, and Payments — from low-latency networking infrastructure to high-reliability ad serving to real-time payment systems processing thousands of transactions a day. I recently wrapped up a 3-year stint in Tokyo and I'm looking for the next interesting problem to solve.

### 🛠 Projects Outside of Work

* **Gokon** — Built a social event coordination app with SwiftUI for iOS and a Flask backend API. The app lets people coordinate and manage events anonymously without sharing PII. It was also an experiment in partnering with coding agents to take an idea from concept to execution. Check out the demo and iOS code at [gokon-ios-client](https://github.com/dzarrini/gokon-ios-client) and the backend at [gokon-server](https://github.com/dzarrini/gokon-server).
* **[Celestial Sphere!](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2024/08/04/celestial_sphere)** — Interactive 3D visualization of 10,000 stars from the Hipparcos Star Catalog.
* **[High FPS GIF?](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2025/07/07/gif)** — A from-scratch GIF encoder written in C following the GIF89a specification, built specifically to test how browsers handle high frame rate GIFs. Here's the code: [gif-encoder](https://github.com/dzarrini/gif-encoder).
* **[Lichess Analysis](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2025/03/20/lichess)** — I was always curious about the deadliest square in chess, so I analyzed 201M+ games on Lichess to find out. Code: [lichess](https://github.com/dzarrini/lichess).
* **[Ultimate Word in Wordle](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2024/08/20/wordle)** — Applied information theory to find the optimal Wordle opening word. Spoiler alert: it's *SALET*. Code: [wordle](https://github.com/dzarrini/wordle).
* **[Catch Pikachu](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2024/08/06/)** — Built a game using the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console with Lua and collision physics. Code: [pico-8](https://github.com/dzarrini/pico-8).
* **Connect4** — My attempt in university to solve Connect 4 using Alpha-Beta Pruning. Code: [connect-4](https://github.com/apatel23/Connect4).
