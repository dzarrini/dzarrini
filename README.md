## Hi there 👋

Hey! I'm Dan — a software engineer with about 8 years of experience building things at scale. I've spent most of my career at Google, working across Cloud, Ads, and Payments — from low-latency networking infrastructure to high-reliability ad serving to real-time payment systems processing thousands of transactions a day. I recently wrapped up a 3-year stint in Tokyo and I'm looking for the next interesting problem to solve.

### My projects outside of work

* **Gokon**: Created a social event coordination app build with SwiftUI for iOS with a Flask backend API. The purpose of this app was to let anonymous people coordinate and manage events without sharing PII, and also to partner alongside coding agents to see an idea to execution. The demo and iOS code can be seen at [gokon-ios-client](https://github.com/dzarrini/gokon-ios-client) and the backend code at [gokon-server](https://github.com/dzarrini/gokon-server).
* **[Celestial Sphere!](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2024/08/04/celestial_sphere)** : Interactive 3D visualization of 10,000 stars from the Hipparcos Star Catalog.
* **[High FPS GIF?](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2025/07/07/gif)**: A from-scratch GIF encoder written in C following the GIF89a specification, built specifically to test how browsers handle high frame rate GIFs. This the code I wrote to make the gifs [gif-encoder](https://github.com/dzarrini/gif-encoder).
* **[Lichess Analysis](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2025/03/20/lichess)**: Was always curious about the most deadliest square in Chess. So I analyzed 201M+ games on lichess. The Code for that is [lichess](https://github.com/dzarrini/lichess).
* **[Ultimate word in Wordle](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2024/08/20/wordle)**: Applied information theory to find the optimal Wordle opening word. Spoiler alerts its *SALET*. The Code for that is [Wordle](https://github.com/dzarrini/wordle).
* **[Catch Pikachu](https://dan.tokyo.jp/blog/2024/08/06/)**: Build a game using [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console with Lua and collision physics. The code for that is here [pico-8](https://github.com/dzarrini/pico-8).
* **Connect4**: This was my attempt in university to solve Connect4 using AlphaBeta Pruning. The code for that is [connect-4](https://github.com/apatel23/Connect4).
